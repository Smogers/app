# Backend

Our backend is rather tiny, it coworks with next.js which connects our rendering methods(client-side and server-side).

Elements that our Backend consists of:
-**app.js** - our main server file
- **routes** - folder which contains whole routing
    -**website.js** - router for website, it contains only data to be rendered by next.js
