# Backend

Our backend is rather tiny, it coworks with next.js which connects our rendering methods(client-side and server-side).

Elements that our Backend consists of:

## Modules

### **api_modules**

folder containing modules, used in api.

**List of modules:**

- #### **selectQuery.js**
  Module which exports Promise as export parent and escape function as exports children. It sends query to the db and returns result. If query succeed then it resolves with result. Otherwise it will reject with an error given by database. It uses Pool connection to make connection stable. But it uses more user connections than usual connection to db. Be aware of running out of connections.

  **To do: dynamic user changing, and change user depending on node env variable.**

  - ##### requires/exports:

    - **requires:**
      - mysql
    - **exports**
      - query function - async function returning Promise which returns result of given query on resolve or query error on reject
