# Backend

Our backend is rather tiny, it coworks with next.js which connects our rendering methods(client-side and server-side).

Elements that our Backend consists of:

## Modules

### **api_modules**

- folder containing file selectQuery.js which is used for establishing connection between server and database by making poolConnection.

#### requires/exports

- **requires:**
  - mysql
- **exports**
  - query function - async function returning Promise which returns result of given query on resolve or query error on reject

## Files
